	<h1>Vertex Array Objects (7/7/2023 3:40PM) #1</h1>
	<p>A Vertex Array Object encapsulates the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>1+ Vertex Buffer(s)</li>
		<li>(Optional) 1 Index Buffer</li>
		<li>1+ Vertex Attributes</li>
		<li>"Enabled" state for Vertex Attributes</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="small">
		VAOs are objects that store <i>pointers</i> to each of these
		constituent objects, so if a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) is attached to
		a VAO, and then the VBO is changed, draw calls using the VAO will see
		that change.
	</p>
	<p>Each of these objects can be bound individually, but to do so
		would require an OpenGL API call for each binding. When a VAO is used,
		the VAO can be bound in one call.</p>
	<p>In OpenGL's "Compatibility" profile, there's a default VAO, so
		the developer does not have to set up a VAO to draw things. In the
		"Core" profile, this is not the case; a developer needs to set up a
		VAO to draw vertex data on the GPU.</p>
	<p class="small">A common misconception is that a VAO should be set
		up then used to render different models, each with its own VBO. In
		practice, each mesh typically has its own VAO. Even though a VAO can
		encapsulate multiple VBOs at the same time, these data all get passed
		to the GPU as one whole object going through the rendering pipeline,
		because they're all coming from the same VAO.</p>
	<p>
		The call to <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code> makes use of the
		currently bound <b>VBO</b>. Specifically, whenever vertex attribute
		information is specified using <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code>, it
		is specified <i>for the currently bound VBO</i>, (and that specified
		information is stored inside the VAO). When the VAO is used for
		drawing later on, the data for the vertex attribute that was specified
		is drawn from the VBO bound when <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code>
		was called.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		<code>glVertexAttribPointer</code> specifies the format information
		for a single vertex attribute, which gets stored in the currently
		bound VAO. That attribute information contains a reference to the VBO
		to grab the actual data from. When drawing, the currently bound VBO is
		not used, but rather, whatever VBO is referenced in the VAO is used.
		This is because different vertex attributes may come from different
		VBOs and only one VBO can be bound at once, so it would not be
		possible to bind multiple VBOs for multiple sources for vertex
		attributes simultaneously during one draw call. Instead, references to
		the VBOs to grab vertex attributes from are stored in the VAO.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a VAO is finished being set up, the vertex attribute arrays that
		were enabled should be disabled. Apparently, the state affected by
		calls to <code>glEnableVertexAttribArray</code> persists beyond the
		VAO binding.
